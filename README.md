<!--HTML Tags Explained--!>

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to various HTML tags used in web development, showcasing
their usage and functionality within a simple HTML document. Each tag is explained with
an example: the <html> tag serves as the root element, while <head> contains metadata like the 
<title>, which appears in the browser tab. The <body> houses the main content, including headings 
(<h1> to <h6>),  paragraphs (<p>), and links (<a>). Other important tags include <img> for images,
<ul> and <ol> for lists,<div> for block-level grouping, and <span> for inline styling. Forms are created 
using <form>, <input>, <textarea>, and <button>, while tables utilize <table>, <tr>, <td>, and <th>. Additional 
tags like <blockquote>, <strong>, and <em> provide semantic meaning, and <br> and <hr> offer formatting options. 
Meta tags like <meta> and links to stylesheets with <link> enhance the document, while <script> allows for JavaScript
integration, and <iframe> enables embedding other HTML pages.
